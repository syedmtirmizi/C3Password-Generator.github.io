# C3Password-Generator.github.io

This github is to showcase my abilities in Javascript.

The project is designed to create a random password generator that can be defined by password lengeth and password crtierias. Password criteras include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

The live application can be found here: https://syedmtirmizi.github.io/C3Password-Generator.github.io/
